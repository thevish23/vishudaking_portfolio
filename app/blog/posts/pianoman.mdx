summary: 'A hand-cranked mechanical toy featuring a mannequin that tilts its head and mimics piano playing using a clever system of cams and linkages, accompanied optionally by a classic music box tune.'

## Abstract

The Piano Man Automata was designed as a mechanical toy to bring a sense of calm and curiosity to its user. Through an elegant series of cams and linkages, it animates a mannequin that moves its hands like a piano player and tilts its head side to side. A built-in music box can be triggered by pushing the crank inward, adding a nostalgic layer of sensory feedback to the visual motion.

## Project Goals & Design Specifications

Primary goals:
- Deliver stress-relief and visual engagement  
- Mimic piano playing motion and head tilting  
- Integrate optional musical output  
- Maintain mechanical simplicity and user safety  
- Be library-safe (silent by default)

Design constraints:
- All motion powered by a single hand crank  
- Music box toggle without altering crank direction  
- Non-intrusive size and clear motion path visibility  
- Safe for ages 16+ (no finger poking!)

## Detailed Design Discussion

The Piano Man’s body is driven by a hand crank that powers a cam-based linkage mechanism:

- The crank controls two main motions: head tilting and arm actuation.  
- A set of cams convert rotational input into the up-down motion of the mannequin’s hands, visually imitating piano playing.  
- A secondary linkage offsets the camshaft to tilt the head left and right, giving it a lifelike expression.  
- The hand crank can be pushed inward to engage the music box through a mechanical switch.

## Creative Theme

 Its minimal yet expressive motions mimic human musicality, while its form factor encourages mindful engagement. Inspired by vintage toy aesthetics, it is equally at home on a desk or a bookshelf.

## Mechanism Performance and Reflection

The Piano Man performed reliably, producing consistent and engaging movement across all intended degrees of freedom:

**Strengths:**
- Smooth head-tilting and arm motions  
- Intuitive user interface via crank-push toggle  
- Durable under repeated crank cycles

**Observed Issues:**
- Slight lag in arm return due to cam clearance  
- Sound trigger occasionally lose without full push  
- Tolerances tight in some printed linkages causing limited head tilt range of motion.

**Recommendations for Future Iterations:**
- Refine cam profile for more fluid motion  
- Improve spring-back on sound engagement  
- Tweak crank-handle ergonomics with gear sleeves.
