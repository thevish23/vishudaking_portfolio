## Abstract

Our team was tasked with creating a robotic walker that could traverse the incline between Boneyard Creek and the Bardeen Quad. We built a walker with three 4-bar linkage legs and two ratcheted wheels, powered by a single motor connected to a planetary gear system. The walker was themed as a "Hextech Chariot" for Professor Heimerdinger and performed well on the 80% incline track.

## Project Goals & Design Specifications

Goals included:
- Uphill walking at ≥ 4 m/min
- Full autonomy with one motor and a battery
- Fit within 12 x 18 x 30 cm³
- No grass damage
- Arcane-themed, amusing and impressive design

Additional design features:
- Ratcheted rear wheels to prevent rollback
- Planetary gear system for increased torque
- Bevel gear system with added supports for robust contact

## Detailed Design Discussion

The chassis was laser-cut ¼” acrylic, with side panels holding the wheels. Most of the parts were 3D printed in PLA and fastened with M4 x 10 mm screws. The motor, mounted in a PLA sleeve, connected to a planetary gear system which fed into bevel gears.

- The planetary system used a sun gear connected to the motor, spinning planets in a fixed ring gear. It had a 3:1 gear-down ratio.
- The output from the planetary system powered a bevel gear pair that redirected torque to a shaft connecting to all three legs.
- Each leg used a crank-rocker 4-bar linkage, with offset phasing (middle leg at 180°) for continuous ground contact.

## Creative Theme

The walker showcased Professor Heimerdinger (from *Arcane*) in his signature pose, with wrenches and an arcane claw. Painted cobalt blue with gold and bronze trim, it visually represented a hextech innovation. Cardboard rear panels enclosed the structure and completed the “chariot” look.

## Mechanism Performance and Reflection

On the 80% incline, the walker showed smooth movement and stable gait due to effective torque transmission. Issues included:
- Bevel gear teeth shearing from small contact area
- Planetary gear slippage due to clearance tolerances
- Leg assemblies bending and detaching under load

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- Increase bevel gear size and contact
- Tighten gear tolerances
- Reinforce leg joints
- Redesign gait for better ground clearance

## Expense Report

**Budget:** $60.93 (including $11.93 carryover from Project 1)  
**Total Cost:** $60.72  
- $20: Laser-cut acrylic (Jackson Studio)
- $12.87: PLA
- $8.00: Screws
- ~$20: Paints and decorations

Remaining budget: **$0.21**
